# OUTPOST REMAKE

# About project
A long time ago, when I was a kid, this was one of the first computer games I saw. For that reason now I try to do remake with better graphic. Rules is same like original game, with 2 differences - player have only one life, and shield damage consumed energy.

# Original game description
Outpost is a variant of the arcade shoot 'em up Space Zap. The player is in command of an unarmed space outpost that has to be defended against the attacks of the Kamicosmic-Gruds. The outpost is located in the middle of the screen and the enemies appear from the sides. They will destroy the outpost if they manage two hits on the same side of the outpost or four hits on one of it's corners. The player has to destroy them by firing propulsion units from the corresponding side of the outpost. It is also possible to place shields to block the enemies' fire but only on one side at a time.
